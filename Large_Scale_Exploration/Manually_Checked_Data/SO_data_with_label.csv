Android : Bitmap causing out of memory error,"android,bitmap",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36141094/android-bitmap-causing-out-of-memory-error,True,out of memory,Memory Consumption,Image,"I'm having some troubles with memory leaks on Android.
I do have a simple application with a relatively picture as background and it works fine, until I change the orientation.
The following is a graph showing the memory leak (allocated memory over time). Every spike corresponds to an orientation change, and every spike is +20M of allocated memory
At ~ 30 seconds the app crashes with an obvious ""OutOfMemory"" error:
Throwing OutOfMemoryError ""Failed to allocate a 17469452 byte allocation with 804912 free bytes and 786KB until OOM""`




I've managed to solve the problem.
It was all because of a damn timer which was setting a tick event on every screen orientation change.
To fix the issue I simply binded the timer to a variable, and called timer.cancel() in onSaveInstance()

After some search, I found the leak is caused by the MyLocationNewOverlay.enableMyLocation() method:

If I comment that line out, there will be no memory leak. I think I forgot to deregister the location listener at onPause() or OnStop(). So I try to deregister it at onPause() by using:

However, the leak still occurs. I even tried to remove the whole mMyLocationNewOverlay but it still doesn't work. I am wondering what is the proper way to deregister the location listener in OsmDroid and fix the memory leak?

Shortly after I posted the question, I found the solution myself. In short, the solution is whenever a new MyLocationNewOverlay is added, the old MyLocationNewOverlay must be disabled BEFORE removal by calling:

Simply removing the overlay wouldn't work because the callback is still holding the reference of the overlay.

Of course, the best practice is to have only one MyLocationNewOverlay and manage the same (I made the mistake of adding a new one). I hope this will help someone with the same problem.",,,,1,1,1

I want to max out with 20 pieces for my app but so far according to my android studio memory log once bitmap factory is done creating one puzzle piece I’m using up around 18mb of memory, after 20 pieces are created along with all the other functions of the app I’m using up 400+mb of memory which I must use “largeHeap=true” to keep from running out of memory, but I’m so close to exceeding those higher limits that the app is super sluggish and enough animated activity will inevitably crash the app
I would love to know what those other play store puzzle apps are doing that I’m not
any input is greatly appreciated
FYI I’m using PNG24 for my images and the dimension on my test image is 556x720

It does not restore anything inside the ""else"" block above. In effect, anything that was setup during that time disappears. Therefore, only the website was saved and none of the WebView and WebChrome client were.

This caused the behavior mentioned above.

By moving setup block from the ""else"" block outside of it, my webview was able to set itself up again with the necessary settings.

Asynctask Memory Leak Warning Android,"android,memory-leaks,android-asynctask",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69995118/asynctask-memory-leak-warning-android,True,memory leak,Memory Consumption,AsyncTask,"I have created as asynctask to upload data to a server as below. But it shows this warning eaxctly at class AsyncTaskUploadClass. ""This AsyncTask class should be static or leaks might occurs......"" I have read and tried the weak reference style but i am unable to integrate it in this code.

It's in the nature of inner classes of Java- a class within a class has a hidden reference to the parent instance. That can cause memory leaks. The way to avoid that is to make it a static inner class- static class Foo. This will cause it to remove the hidden reference, but the inner class will no longer be able to reference functions or member variables of the parent.

More practically- this type of AsyncTask, while it technically can cause a temporary leak, is fairly safe as long as the doInBackground function terminates in a reasonable amount of time. For this class, if imageProcessClass.ImageHttpReques() runs and terminates (with either a timeout error or by finishing its work) in a reasonable amount of time it isn't a leak worry- it just that the parent class, which looks like an Activity, will not be freed until it does so. So it will force the parent class to stick around for a second or two longer than needed if the Activity is finished but the request is processing.",,,,1,1,1

Your code will temporarily leak the Resources object in between the times when the Activity is destroyed and the next time it is recreated (in onCreate() when you call initialize() again and overwrite which Resources object is being held by reference). If that's just the time during an orientation change, it's trivial. But if it's during the time between the user backing out of the Activity and the next time they return to the app, then your app will be hanging onto a little more memory than necessary.

Avoid holding Context references in static fields: pass an AppDatabase instance instead of a Context.
Manage AppDatabase instances using the singleton model: Ensure that the AppDatabase is used as a singleton in the application, which avoids duplicate creation and holding of Context references.
Use dependency injection frameworks such as Dagger2 or Dagger-Hilt to manage dependencies, further simplifying dependency management and lifecycle control.",1,1,1

Can this code cause memory leak in android,"android,kotlin,memory-leaks",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57942197/can-this-code-cause-memory-leak-in-android,True,memory leak,No,No,,,,"Using WeakReference will most likely prevent your code from leaking here (although it depends whether newData has any references to the Context - I assume it doesn't), maintaining a collection that keeps Activities is almost never a good idea and is - more often than not - a sign of a bad design.

Especially if such collection has a static nature - like in your case. It'll live as long as your app process lives (which may be days, or longer), and it'll grow in size each time user navigates to another Activity or performs a configuration change. This concern can be mitigated by using WeakHashMap, but it doesn't make it a better architecture in any way.

In case you need to initialize AbcManager only once per single Activity instance, why not just keeping it as a field? Possibly with by lazy if you want to be sure you don't instantiate it before your Activity is in a proper state.",0,0,0

Although ANR occurs, if I don't terminate at the point of ANR occures and press 'wait' to keep application running, the application goes well as I intended. I have been tried to find how to resolve the problem for a long time, but I can't finally make my application stop occuring ANR.

In Android, a Service is running on the main thread which already has a Looper assign with it. In your code, when the service is started, it calls Looper.prepare() and Looper.loop() on the main thread, it will cause unexpected behavior with your app.

android universal image loader out of memory,"android,universal-image-loader",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36323478/android-universal-image-loader-out-of-memory,True,out of memory,Memory Consumption,Image,"Image Loading
If you often got OutOfMemoryError in your app using Universal Image Loader then:

Disable caching in memory. If OOM is still occurs then it seems your app has a memory leak. Use MemoryAnalyzer to detect it. Otherwise try the following steps (all of them or several):

Potential memory leaks when using searchView along with ROOM database and live data,"java,android,kotlin,android-room,android-architecture-components",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76982259/potential-memory-leaks-when-using-searchview-along-with-room-database-and-live-d,True,memory leak,Memory Consumption,Database Operation,"I'm looking to implement a SearchView feature in an app that utilizes the ROOM library. During my online research, I noticed that many examples follow a pattern similar to the one below:

Now, I'm curious to know if I'm getting the whole thing right. Could it be the case that with this approach, a new observer is created each time a user enters a new letter and the onQueryTextChange method is triggered? If that's the case, does this potentially lead to memory leaks? Or, on the other hand, does the viewLifecycleOwner automatically handle these observers, ensuring they are disposed of when they're no longer needed?

From what you’ve shown, this does leak observers. There will be obsolete observers sitting in memory for almost every character typed or deleted until the Fragment’s view is destroyed. Even worse, if these observers come from Room, they will all be running queries every time the database is modified until they are released.

One way to avoid this would be to use a switch map operation based on the search query. The switch map operation does exactly what we want…when there is new data, it cancels observing the previous LiveData and starts a new one. This is done under its own hood, so to an outside observer, it’s just a single LiveData stream.",new pattern,,,1,1,1

But there is some memory leak as it is set in BaseActivity like\
I think my context is leaking as user switch from one activity to another But mInstance is not null due to singleton object




Your SensorOrientationChangeNotifier class holds a reference to the Context you pass to it. Since you pass the Activity as your Context parameter, it is holding a reference to your Activity for as long as it is alive, which is forever since it is a singleton. You were naming your parameters applicationContext but in practice you were using an Activity instance instead.

To fix it, make sure you pull the applicationContext out of the Activity and use that. You can't leak the Application's Context, because it lasts for the lifetime of the application instance.

Also, there's no reason to be returning a nullable from your getInstance() function. And your TAG right now evaluates to ""Companion"", which isn't very useful. Here it is with both of those things fixed:",example,,,1,1,1

The file size is around 12MB. I am able to download the file when I try the same in a browser, so I don't think its a problem with the endpoint.

The amount of memory for Java code on Android is limited to something like 16 Mb (varies by device). So you either need to move this part to native NDK code, where you can malloc() as much memory as your device has, or save the file directly to disk, then process it without loading the whole file into Java buffers. Use URLConnection.getInputStream() or URLConnection.read() in a loop with a 16Kb byte array instead of copying the whole file into response array. Or you can read it line-by-line directly from the HTTP stream, using BufferedReader.readLine(), and fill your database line-by-line.

After about 2000 points, the app becomes unresponsive on my phone. I don't think it's because the array is getting too big because when I pull all of the data from the database (sometimes over 6000 rows), it follows the same logic and paints the map just fine (using the array). I'm wondering if it's because I have everything running on the main thread (music playing, google map, location services, database inserts, textview changes etc). If that's the culprit, how should I change this up to put things in a different thread? What should go in the different thread? And lastly, how would I write up moving any of these things to a different thread (code samples or point me to a resource).

The WindowLeaked exception in your case is happening because you are not dismissing the MyProgressDialog before finishing the activity. Hence it is leaking the memory associated with it.

General case :

The WindowLeaked exception generally happens when you have some sort of async task that is finishing after the activity that began it, is destroyed.This type of Exception is occurred in case mainly for Dialogs,where we did not dismiss the dialogs before the Activity Context is destroyed.

So it is better to put a check before showing the dialog

A full size picture took by camera is pretty large. Let's say maybe 4 million pixels, if you are using RGB8888 to read as bitmap, it will cost about 16mb. If you want to load 2 pictures at the same time, it is likely to out of memory.
There are several ways could help.
Read the bitmap with a sample size, which will lower the resolution of the bitmap. See this page for details.
Use RGB565 instead of RGB8888 to read the bitmap. Since your bitmap will be opaque, the alpha channel will be useless.
Recycle the old bitmap before creating a new one. This is what you can try fist.

If I do not download the Images, and just put in a Hard-Coded Image with the size of 1200kb (dimension 1920 x 1080) per custom view, my app only consumes around 40Mb of memory.

Recycle bitmaps when not in use. Use a view holder for better performance. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDBM6wVEO70. I suggest you have a look at the link.

I'm busy for android to upload images from a app.
I also got it working (code will follow below).
But when i send large images (10 megapixels) my app crashes with an out-of-memory exception.
A solution for this is to use compression but what if i want to send the full size image?
I think perhaps something with a stream but i'm not familair with streams. Perhaps urlconnection might help to but i really have no idea.

I give the filename the name File[0 to 9999].jpg The post value with the image date is called Filedata I give a UID for the post value dropboxid

The code below works but i would love to solve my problem that prevents me from sending high res images.


When using ByteArrayOutputStream and then calling #toByteArray() you've effectively doubled the amount of memory the JPEG is using. ByteArrayOutputStream keeps an internal array with the encoded JPEG and when you call #toByteArray() it allocates a new array & copies the data from the internal buffer.

Consider encoding large bitmaps to a temporary file & using FileOutputStream and FileInputStream to encode and send the image.

Without ""uploading"" - your app survives ""nicely"" with the just the huge bitmap in memory I assume?

I have managed to display the picture in 6 bits and I thought things were going well, but now the app crashes after a few swipes (about 7 to 8) as the memory runs out.

Is there any obvious bad practices I am doing here that is causing the memory loss?

As @alex.veprik mentioned: try to use one OnClickListener, and assign it to all your EditText-objects. If you create a new OnClickListener for every EditText-object, although they all do the same, this will eat a lot of your memory.

It might also be wise to put the creation of your EditText-objects in a loop, and to store only the list of all boxes in a member variable. So instead of having 150 variables, you now only need one for the list, while at the same time keeping all the references. (this doesn't affect your memory problem, but it's good code style)

I already tried a

In my hprof dump, my activity (named 'Browser') has the following remaining GC roots (after having called destroy() on it):
Now, unfortunately there has been no reply on the blog or the mailing list about this question yet. Therefore I am wondering, is that a bug in the SDK (maybe similar to the MapView bug as reported http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=2181) or how to get the activity entirely off the memory with a webview embedded?

I conclude from above comments and further tests, that the problem is a bug in the SDK: when creating a WebView via XML layout, the activity is passed as the context for the WebView, not the application context. When finishing the activity, the WebView still keeps references to the activity, therefore the activity doesn't get removed from the memory. I filed a bug report for that , see the link in the comment above.

How do I keep from running out of memory on graphics for an Android app?,"android,graphics,memory-management",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2800728/how-do-i-keep-from-running-out-of-memory-on-graphics-for-an-android-app,True,out of memory,No,No,"I've been working on an Android app in Eclipse, and so far, my program hasn't really grown past midget size. However I've already run into an issue with an Out of Memory error. You see, I've been using graphics comprised solely of bitmaps and PNGs in this program, and recently, when I tried to add a little bit more functionality to the program (mainly including a few more bitmaps and causing an extra sprite to be created), it started crashing in the graphics thread's constructor -> sprite's constructor. When I tracked the problem down, it turned out to be an Out of Memory error that is seemingly caused by adding too many picture files to the program and creating Drawables out of them.

This would be a problem, as I really don't have that many picture resources worked into that program...maybe 20 or so. I haven't even started to include sound yet. These images aren't all that fancy. My questions are this:

1) Are programs for the Android phone really that limited on how much memory they can employ, or is it probably something other than the 20-30 resource pictures causing that error?

2) If the memory for Android apps is so awful it can't even handle 20-30 picture resources being loaded into Drawables that exist at the same time, then how in the world are you supposed to make decent graphics and sound for that thing?

As already mentioned by Steve and Paul, the crucial factor is how big your images are. Android applications are limited to 16Mb on standard phones, and 24Mb on hidef phones. That is a hard limit. This severely limits the amount of graphics you have.
It's easy to calculate your graphic size: width x height x size of pixel (16 or 32 bit).
Some tips:
You need to check your code carefully for memory leaks. It is extremely easy to leak memory in Android, and if you leak a couple of bitmaps a few times, you'll run out of memory fast. This article may help.
Always load your graphics using ARGB_4444 (16bit) if at all possible. That alone, can reduce memory consumption for graphics by a factor 2.
Always null and recycle resources if you can, to assist the gc.
Try to ensure that graphics are only used once. Having a resource handling class that deals with this can be very useful (at least if you're doing games).",,,,0,0,0

Memory leak detected in Chrome Custom Tabs,"android,google-chrome,memory-leaks,chrome-custom-tabs",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32406650/memory-leak-detected-in-chrome-custom-tabs,True,memory leak,Memory Consumption,Activity,"I'm attempting to implement Chrome Custom Tabs and detecting a memory leak through LeakCanary.

The demo application does not appear to leak unless we add another Activity layer (i.e. MainActivity launches Activity2, which binds/unbinds to the custom tab service and launches the url -- everything the MainActivity does in the demo app).

MainActivity looks like this:
Returning from Activity2 to MainActivity will cause this leak:



The MainActivity in the sample creates an instance of CustomTabsServiceConnection and CustomTabsCallback as anonymous inner classes.

If you change them to be static inner classes, therefore removing the this reference to the MainActivity, and set the references to the MainActivity as WeakReferences, you will see that LeakCanary stops reporting about the MainActivity leaking.

Now, you may still see leak canary report about the ServiceConnection leaking if you set it to watch that object. The reason is that it is linked to the Chrome service and cannot be cleaned by GC until GC also runs on the server side.

I created a test that binds and unbinds the Service in a loop and I've confirmed that the ServiceConnections are indeed being collected after a while.

So, the Demo can be improved in order to avoid the ServiceConnection holding a reference to the MainActivity, avoiding having a heavy object like an Activity being alive a long time after the service is disconnected, and it's not a problem with the Custom Tabs library.

So: Am I going about this the wrong way? Is loading it as a Bitmap to intensive? What alternatives are there?

Displaying the images stored on the phone seems like a really trivial, basic task. What is the ""right"" way to do this, and is there anyway I can make this way work?

There can be many problems with bitmaps in android but first of all your adapter implementation is really bad, you don't re-use list rows and I'm sure it's pretty laggy and this might be source of your problems.

What you need to do first is to read about convertView pattern, use it and then tell us if the problem still occurs.

UPDATE:

First of wall you don't need to get LayoutInflater every time getView() is called, you can set it in adapters constructor and then reuse it.

Next listView has a mechanism to create only number of rows which are visible on the screen, when one row gets of the screen then it's reused. What you need to do is to check if you have to create a new row from scratch or reuse existing one and fill it with new data.

Of course you can do some further optimalization using Holder patter.

Android custom view Bitmap memory leak,"android,out-of-memory,ondraw,custom-view",https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4197794/android-custom-view-bitmap-memory-leak,True,memory leak,Memory Consumption,Image,"Bitmap
I've got a custom view in which I need to draw two bitmaps, one is a background, representing the image of a map and one is a pin which will be drawn on top/left position in canvas.
The both images are drawn onDraw and remain the same during the live of the activity that contains the view. After a while I get a
OutOfMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget
This means that I have a leak and the bitmaps don't get garbage collected. I asked this question before, but now the situation changed a little. I made a init method where I set the bitmaps I want to use but this still isn't a good approach, the error appears later, but still there.

You need to close your database before you reopen it, the stack trace message is quite clear about what the problem is.
One solution is to make use of the android.app.Application class and store the open database instance in there. If you do do this, be sure to open the database using the Application context rather than the Activity context otherwise you can leak the context when your activity is destroyed.
The other solution is to close the database in onDestroy/onStop, etc and reopen it in onCreate/onStart, etc.",exmaple,,,1,1,1

This works fine, however I now want to use a notification in the notification bar so keep track of the download instead (as the file can be rather large and users would like to keep track from outside the app).

I have tried the below code however the UI starts to lag badly, I can see its due to the publishProgress getting called alot, so how could I go about changing the background code to call publishProgress only every second


I have done this before for an upload function that showed the % in a Notification, but same exact idea. Have your AsyncTask keep track of what percentDone the download is, and ONLY call publishProgress when percentDone changes. That way, you will only ever call publishProgress when the % downloaded changes, and the Notification therefore needs to update. This should resolve the UI lag.

Any thoughts on how to make UI updateable (or run this method like if a Thread)?

You are calling Thread.sleep(10000); on the UI thread so it will freeze. You should never do this.
I'm not sure what you mean by ""that's not the problem"" but you can move Thread.sleep(...) to one of your Threads or AsyncTask that you have

I am facing a strange problem of out of memory in my app. I have made R&D and i found many way to solve this problem but i have faced same issue. What exactly i m doing is captureing images from camera ----> storing it inside the sdcard -----> displaying eight(8) images in on screen like on row and two images (total 4 rows and 8 images) Here in this screen i can see bitmap images successfully in image view. But i have implemented one more functionality is when clicked on the any image view out of this 8 image view this image will be prompted as big images as what screen size is.

You have created second object of bitmap to return it back from ""rotateBitmap"". Isn't it possible to do following?
I like to suggest some points to notice on.

Make function for every method you are using.
whenever you want to use any ""memory hunger"" object, declare it with ""WeakReference"". After using it, it has method to clear reference. This will reduce memory when GC will get no reference to your Bitmap used in your method.
Don't load full sized bitmap, instead load bitmap with width and height specified.

You should instead, call bindService without spawning user thread. One main reason is that, this causes memory leak.

When there is configuration change, as long the the thread still alive, it doesn't give chance to Activity for performing garbage collection. This is because your user thread is still holding reference to Activity.

An Anonymous class is never static so it will have an implicit reference to the containing class (namely the MyActivity), besides the explicit WeakReference.

Since the onCreate() runs on the main thread, the Handler - that is created inside the onCreate() - will be associated with the main tread (actually the main Looper that is created when the Application starts). If you post a Message (or a Runnable, since the Runnable will be wrapped around with a Message) to the Handler, that Message/Runnable will have a reference to the Handler.

So given you postDelayed something with 5 mins delay. After destroying the Activity (eg. because of rotation), the main Looper will have a reference to the Message/Runnable, the Message/Runnable will have a reference to the Handler, Handler will have a reference to the Activity for 5 mins.

locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, 0, 0, locationListener);
in the onCreate of the service.

To end the GPS i used

locationManager.removeUpdates(locationListener);
in the onDestroy of the service.

You have to do the starting and stopping of the gps in a service, so that you can start and stop the same instances of the location listener otherwise this thing will go drastically wrong",,1,1,1
