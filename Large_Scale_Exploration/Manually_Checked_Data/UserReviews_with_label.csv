I'm using a Galaxy S10e and I can barely navigate to anything within the app without the entire app freezing up and becoming unresponsive. I have to make/request payments SUPER quick before the app decides to freeze. (Original) It's cool. You can do what you need to: Send & Receive money without a bunch of fees. If only they'd stop pushing the other services so much (like using Venmo at various locations).",8.21.1,20210525,unresponsive,Responsiveness,,1,1,1
com.weather.Weather,Haber had this app for better part of 5 years. Was always my go to. Lately in the last number of months I'm beginning to hate it. The ads have becomes purely horrific. Constantly closing then out just trying to navigate from one screen too another. The UI has become very sluggish and often doesn't respond. For the last couple weeks I'm getting app not responding alerts. It might be time to move on,10.55.0,20220819,sluggish,Responsiveness,,1,1,1

com.clearchannel.iheartradio.controller,"It's a great app, but I'm uninstalling it off my phone because it requires too much memory. 200MB? Might not be much memory to some people, but rough on old model phones like the Moto E5. Plus that's equivalent to the video size of a 23 min Family Guy episode. Don't get me wrong, there's a large variety of music stations for free. But it still deserves a 5 Star rating for what is has to offer.
