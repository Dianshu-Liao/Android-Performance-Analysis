https://github.com/ivpn/android-app/issues/220,Latency information not displayed in the list of servers,"### Description:
Occasionally, when switching between protocols or when manually refreshing the servers latency, it is observed that the latency information is missing.
I noticed the issue because sometimes the app was selecting different servers when switching protocols while ""fastest server"" was selected.

### Expected result:
App should always display the latency information when switching between protocols or when manually refreshing the servers latency.

### Steps to reproduce:
1. Install 2.8.4 or beta 2.8.6.
2. Login.
3. Make sure the latency values are present in the list of servers.
4. Select fastest server.
5. Refresh the servers latency repeatedly until the issue occurs.
6. Alternatively, change the protocols several times, from WireGuard to OpenVPN and vice versa, until the issue occurs.

### Environment:
IVPN: 2.8.4 or beta 2.8.6
OS: Samsung Galaxy S10 Android 11","['type: bug', 'priority: medium']",latency

A customer reports:

> When connecting to ivpn fastest server, it connects to a server in Netherlands, which is 100's of miles away from me and should have a high ping. (Download speeds, and rendering of simple webpages takes a lot longer than they should on this server)

https://github.com/zaneschepke/wgtunnel/issues/87,[FEATURE] - Local HTTP/SOCKS5 proxy mode for use with other VPNs,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
For quite a long time now I've always been torn between using the best ad blocker for Android, AdGuard, and using Cloudflare Warp via WireGuard for faster internet (no video buffering, less ping in video games, etc). I can't use both because Android only allows one VPN active at a time. AdGuard does have an automatic proxy mode for rooted devices to allow using WireGuard with it though, but ad filtering will not work if an ipv6 address is specified in the WireGuard config, which must result in me essentially connecting to ipv4 only, in order to continue experiencing the best of both AdGuard and Cloudflare Warp.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A mode in WG Tunnel that allows exposing configs to other compatible VPNs, like AdGuard, in a form of a local (127.0.0.1:xxxx) HTTP and/or SOCKS5 inbound proxy. In this manner, AdGuard, in it's regular VPN mode can filter ads in both ipv4 and ipv6 connections like normal, but through the proxy, so that I may also experience the benefits of Cloudflare Warp.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
- Kernel userspace mode in WireGuard: with that enabled, whether AdGuard is in VPN mode or automatic proxy, the same undesirable results occur so long as an ipv6 config is specified in the WireGuard config.
- SagerNet (depreciated; based on v2-ray) & successor, sing-box (based on sing-box): both SagerNet and sing-box cannot refresh its proxy connection automatically, so when the Android device regains cell service or connects/disconnects from Wifi, all apps not excluded from AdGuard filtering in VPN mode will not connect to the internet until the responsible proxy app is manually stopped and restarted.
- SagerNet fork, Matsuri (depreciated; based on v2-ray) & successor, NekoBoxForAndroid (based on sing-box): Matsuri, like SagerNet, did not well support WireGuard configs, as the app's base arch, v2-ray, does not support WireGuard configs at all, so connections were often unstable; NekoBoxForAndroid, like both Matsuri and SagerNet, 1): have a lot more settings that I deem unnecessary, unappealing, and just confusing for my use case, that, if tampered with, with limited proper knowledge of them, can drastically affect the connection for better or worse, and 2): are simply battery drainers compared to sing-box and WireGuard itself.

**Additional context**
I recently found another GitHub project called [Wireproxy](https://github.com/pufferffish/wireproxy). I haven't tried it, but, given the description of the project, it seems to present the solution related to my issue, it's just not made for Android. Hopefully it's content helps though.

https://github.com/emanuele-f/PCAPdroid/issues/398,Improve full payload mode,"The current implementation of the full payload option is quite limiting, as it's almost ""all or nothing"". With the introduction of the decryption rules, since the TLS decryption can now happen during normal monitoring, it's often necessary to review some decrypted data in full while avoiding the app from going out of memory because of the full payload.

In essence we need a more dynamic approach, here are some ideas:
- give the user the ability to selectively enable the full payload at runtime. Also possibly evaluate to enable it always for decrypted connections
- always keep the most recent x MB of payload in memory, so that the user can always review the most recent connections payload
- possibly implement an alternative file-backed payload dump to overcome the ram limits",['enhancement'],out of memory

https://github.com/beemdevelopment/Aegis/issues/1183,ANR after biometric authentication,"We received an email from a user who is encountering ANR popups after unlocking Aegis using biometric authentication (but not if they unlock using their password). They also sent over a screen recording, but since it contains some personal information, I won't share it here. I'll describe it instead:
- Aegis is launched
- The biometric prompt is shown and the user authenticates
- The biometric prompt is closed and the app then visibly hangs in ``AuthActivity`` for 5 seconds or so
- ``AuthActivity`` closes and ``MainActivity`` opens
- The user gets ANR prompts once every couple of seconds, even though the app appears to remain responsive throughout this.

They're using Aegis on a **Sony XQ-DC54** running **Android 13**.

They've also sent us a bugreport ZIP that gives us some more insight into what is happening. Just before Android reports the ANR, the following is seen in the log:

Looking at the backtrace of the main thread at the moment of the ANR, we can see that Aegis is communicating with the Keystore service to decrypt the biometric key slot. We see something similar when they're trying to set up biometrics through Aegis' settings menu.

- [X] I will describe the problem with as much detail as possible.
- [X] This request contains only one single feature, **not** a list of multiple (related) features.

### App version

3.2.0

### Where did you get the app from

Google Play

### Problem you may be having, or feature you want

* The current statistics screen contains a mix of historical data (playback; Subscriptions & Years display) and current state-of-affairs (downloads). This is a bit confusing, and distracting.
* The screen is used to manage downloads & cache (see #5987), so should be accessible quickly from the Downloads screen.
* #6875 will cause the other two tabs to take a bit more space (especially in some languages).

### Suggested solution

https://github.com/scubajeff/lespas/issues/111,Increase cache size options,"I have a fairly large image collection 40,000+ and around 200gb in size, I think when I open the app it starts working its way through my collection caching all the old images through to the newest but due to the size when I scroll back the old images will have dropped from the cache.  

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I'm not exactly sure if assigning extra cache is feasible but I'd happily dedicate more space to it if it was.  Ideally I'd like to have all the thumbails cached.",[],cache size
https://github.com/scubajeff/lespas/issues/79,Less than 10% internal archival space ... but there is?,"(Apologies, translating the message from Italian)
This pops up when opening the app: The internal archive space is less than 10%, this prevents Les Pas from synching with the server

... and it does not show Nextcloud folders. 
The app is installed on a Motorola g6 plus running Android 9. Internal memory was indeed full so I added (before installing Les Pas) a microsd and now have 33% of memory available.

Am I missing something? I saw that ""Warn user of low internal storage space"" was a new thing for versione 2.5.14 so, that is why I'm bothering you here.

thanks

https://github.com/OPENER-next/OpenStop/issues/68,Reduce app size by outsourcing images,"Currently the app uses about 50mb of storage just for photos. This is is about 70-80% of the total app size.
We probably should outsource the images to a server or github repository in combination with a local caching method like: https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image

Doing so would require an adjustment of the privacy policy.

Are these images all of small sizes? Do you think they will affect Geopaparazzi's performance?

For the images to be displayed, in many cases, they are larger than required. Because the bitmap display in an app is memory consumption, maybe we should checking and resizing the images before decoding them, which can reduce memory overhead.

https://github.com/spacecowboy/NotePad/issues/387,general TO DO list,"This list tracks all important tasks related to this project. This helps @CampelloManuel schedule work.
Bigger, more complex tasks, mainly those that require collaboration, will get their own github issue.
There is another list for less important tasks in #480



For each release:
* test the app as much as possible
* run `./release.sh`. this creates a tag, and in a few days the new release will appear automatically both on f-droid and the play store



Up next, for 7.1.7:
* [x] version 7.1.6 was only an hotfix for f-droid, so it wasn't published on the play store
* [ ] work on the other issues [in this view](https://github.com/spacecowboy/NotePad/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+-label%3A%22help+wanted%22+-label%3Asecondary+sort%3Aupdated-desc) starting from the newest


Important ideas:
* [ ] the backup and restore functions use an hardcoded filename. Instead, the backup function should let the user pick a directory, and save a .json file there, with the date on the filename, thus also allowing for multiple files. The restore function should open a filepicker to let the user choose a .json file to restore. The code to pick a predefined folder is a bad design choice and should be deleted. #510 shows that the backup and restore functionality is not clear to users.
* [ ] I don't like how the time picker looks like on my samsung. try different styles for the TimePickerDialog, and try MaterialTimePickerDialog of the google library, see which is better. Try also the date picker dialog, but that one is fine I think
* [ ] show markdown effects in the UI, see #511 
* [ ] the shortcut widget has stopped working. it should launch the activity on the selected list, but it doesn't happen when you pause the app with the home screen
* [ ] https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar has a splash screen that shows black instead of white. see how they do and replicate
* [ ] on the tutorial .md file, at the beginning, add a flowchart with mermaid to explain how to navigate the app. If you can, add links to photos or other sections in that tutorial
* [ ] https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar integrates dynamic material colors. see how they do it and replicate
* [ ] update donations on f-droid to show the links in the github repository
* [ ] update the theme.xml to use the **new** material design, ""material YOU"". It's easy: `<style name=""Example"" parent=""Theme.Material3.DynamicColors.Dark""></style>` is enough. but you have to remove the colorPrimary. So maybe adding it as a new theme choice is a good idea. try using daynight as a base. this site generates themes https://m3.material.io/theme-builder#/custom and this link https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/apply-dynamic-color#5 explains how to use them, but these don't use the **dynamic colors**, which is what I'm trying to do
* [ ] edit the widget settings as requested in #497 , change the label to something like ""Rows of notes to display. Move slider to max to show 99 rows"". Then: Raise the widget note font size by 150 percent. But is there a way you could have the widget font match up with the font sizes we choose in the app? Useful when you set the font size to large in the appearance settings of the app.



New functionality & less important changes: 
* [ ] reorganize namespaces to exploit the package-private feature. Take a big java file ( > 600 lines ) and create a package for it. then split it and keep only 1 class public. if a class has inner classes, split them into their own file and keep them as package private, with only the ""main"" class as visible. do it at least for activitymain and the task*fragment(s)
* [ ] make a ""widgets"" namespace. move the shortcut class there. make a sub-namespace for the list widget, move all list widget classes there. make a new sub-namespace for the third widget of #482 and add new code there
* [ ] refactor all classes so that no file has more than, say, 500 lines of code. This means moving some methods out of ActivityMain and TaskDetailFragment on some static methods into their own helper classes
* [ ] if the user tries to make a backup with password-locked notes, ask for the password before showing the backup dialog. do this both for creating and restoring the backup
* [ ] the light & dark themes are not tied to the system's theme settings: we should have a default theme option that follows the day/night theme setting of the OS
* [ ] remove all the commented out code and unused functions, classes, xml layouts, files and libraries
* [ ] Use AndroidStudio's analyze feature (code analysis, default IDE profile) to get some ideas on what to refactor. Like use of deprecated classes, and so on. will be VERY long
* [ ] remove `org.androidannotations:androidannotations:4.8.0`, which is deprecated. See https://github.com/spacecowboy/NotePad/pull/369 difficult, and not really worth it: the last version supports androidx just fine. and it's from 2020, so it's still usable. TEST CAREFULLY, especially the navigation from widgets. See #465 a **failed** attempt
* [ ] the code is full of TODOs, some are related to the issues in this list. Check and solve them
* [ ] the animations files in `app/src/main/res/anim` are useless. consider deleting them
* [ ] change the locale configuration: instead of a list in `arrays.xml`, do it like this https://gitlab.com/spacecowboy/Feeder/-/blob/master/app/src/main/res/xml/locales_config.xml
* [ ] replace, when possibile, `Toast` with `Snackbar`, possibly with undo actions. especially in the backup preferences page this should be possible
* [ ] the ""shortcut"" widget simply shows the app icon. It would be cool if it showed something different, like a custom ""add note"" icon. See `ShortcutConfig.onOK()`
* [ ] use our custom `NnnLogger` instead of `Log.d()` and `Log.e()` in all calls in the codebase
* [ ] check the commits on the [OpenTracks](https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks) repo in 2019, there could be some good changes to copy
* [ ] find all references of R.string.feature_is_WIP and work on those features
* [ ] big widget: more color options. the only options right now are between ""light"" and ""dark"", and they don't even affect the widget header. try to use the material YOU colors in android 13
* [ ] run `gradlew lint` and fix the reported warnings. See TODO in build.gradle
* [ ] Replace all images with vector graphics: since we target a minimum SDK > 22, there should be no png icons, they can all be vectors (except the ""main"" app icon)
* [ ] add a setting to hide the ""Next 5 days"" page on the left. as of now the user can replace it with something else in the drawer 
* [ ] update featureGraphic, promographic and icon for fastlane
* [ ] use as much as you can the ""compat"" features as opposed to the non-androidx classes
* [ ] check and remove all .py files, which should be useless
* [ ] version 6.0.0 had a button on the actionbar to quickly change the list ordering. In our version, the user has to long-click the list name in the drawer, which may be counter intuitive. maybe we should add a gear next to the list name so that it's clearer how the list settings are edited. as of now there is a folder icon. put a gear there ?
* [ ] to reduce the apk size, we may delete the following useless folders: `drawable-mdpi`, `drawable-xhdpi`, assuming that we are only going to use XML drawables
* [ ] attach photos to notes. If it's too hard, limit it to 1 photo per note. how should they be saved on the database: the entire photo or just its filepath ? alternative: try to fetch and show a photo if its uri or file path is in the note text. alternative: add an import button to TaskDetailFragment to add the file's path to the note as text, and retain the permissions to open the file.
* [ ] add new espresso tests, if possibile
* [ ] make better app icon(s). See https://icon.kitchen/
* [ ] i found this https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/apk-analyzer so you should build a release APK, then check the ""final"" manifest and the proguard mappings
* [ ] check comments and approve suggestions on the weblate project. It's important to do it every once in a while
* [ ] dragging the 1° note on the drag-sort-listview does not work, because the pull-to-refresh action takes precedence. Temporary fix: disabled the SwipeRefreshLayout. It would be cool to have it working, for the 2 users that use the org sync feature
* [ ] Shortcutconfig: use a `+` icon for ""create note"" and a ""list"" icon for ""open list"" actions
* [ ] methods like `Cursor.getContentResolver().query()` are being used outside the designated `com.nononsenseapps.notepad.database` namespace. You should make an Helper class that calls these methods, closes the cursor and returns java objects. This way, Cursor and the database logic are enclosed in that namespace only
* [ ] take a look at the google dev. console. Does the data suggest something ? In particular see which versions/devices crash more

My name is Alejandro Mazuera-Rozo, I am a PhD Student at Universidad de los Andes, and at Università della Svizzera italiana. I am part of a research on the usage of network libraries within Android apps. As result of this we identified some code locations that might have network related problems.

In this case, we address the code locations that are related to a potential issue concerning not offering to the users control over their usage of network resources. If your application performs network operations, you should provide user settings that allow users to control your app’s data habits, such as how often your app syncs data, whether to perform uploads/downloads only when on Wi-Fi, or whether to use data while roaming.

In order to address this issue we recommend:

1. The declaration of an intent filter for the `ACTION_MANAGE_NETWORK_USAGE` action to indicate that your application defines an activity that offers options to control data usage. `ACTION_MANAGE_NETWORK_USAGE` shows settings for managing the network data usage of a specific application.

2. https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops/managing#implement-preference-activity

https://github.com/thetwom/toc2/issues/67,"FR: Multiple metronomes, more logical notation editor","1. It would be really nice to be able to have multiple metronomes going on simultaneously to practice multiple rhythmic patterns. This is mainly for polyrhythms and polymeters(such as 3 against 7 or 5 against 4).

Maybe as sample way to add this feature would be to abstract the metronome so that multiple can be run.

Then add an overlay or easy way to add or remove multiple instances. 

Then it is just a matter of synchronizing the metronomes(so some work on dealing with how the sounds are played is in order. Probably the easiest way is to render the waveform directly to an audio buffer and the ship the buffer to the audio output. The main issue here is to make sure everything is nearly perfectly synced so there are no weird timing issues between the different instances.

2. Add some ability to add a latency to the sound including negative. The issue is that there is some delay from the animation effects and the sound itself and if one is watching the metronome it can be a little discombobulating.
 
3. The notation editor is a nice feature but it is a little strange to use. It would be better if it was more like standard music notation editors in which a beat is literally is specified by the time signature. Then a beat can be divided in a natural way. Currently one has to ""add notes"" but a note is, tempo speaking, an arbitrary unit specified by the notation rather than specified by the meter/bar.  E.g.,  if I add 3 ""units"" those can be anything I say. When a quarter note is selected and turns it in to an eighth note it will change time signature(say from 4/4 to 7/8).

Maybe adding an ""optional logic"" for more standard notation would be better than to replace the current system. This way it could be done gradually. I'm mainly interested in the first request so I can practice polyrhythms more accurately.

https://github.com/NobodyForNothing/blood-pressure-monitor-fl/issues/257,Rethink data storage,"_This issue is more of a collection of thoughts about data storage to reflect on than a concrete design._

## Use of databases

Sqflite was initially chosen to allow fast access to large amounts of measurements and the possibility to easily relate fields. There came some downsides with it like bad testability and a bit of overhead even without any measurements.

It turns out that sqflite still needs to [read the entire database file](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/blob/master/sqflite_common/lib/src/database_file_system_io.dart#L24-L28) and does so from dart code, so the first advantage simply isn't there. Another realization was that SQL is not fit for analyzing blood pressure and the logic needed to be implemented in dart anyway.

Since settings are inherently unique and are stored as JSON objects for better debugability storing them in a database wasn't productive. The use case of multiple profiles was rather fabricated.

## Alternative design

While solutions for this problem can use existing packages, finding good ones is hard and might lead to similar problems like the sqflite solution currently has. Reinventing the wheel is more complex and time-consuming and can lead to the same problems, but these problems will be more actionable.

### Settings

As settings are already JSON serializable and need to be read in their entirety, saving them all in one big file seems more appropriate. 

### Records

A new requirement I would like to introduce for the new measurement model is that it is easy to maintain and expand. It should be possible to introduce attributes to measurements as well as unrelated recorded features like weight and medicines without rewriting large portions of the storage code.

It would be great to track all types of data separately from each other to allow for customization of input fields and use of the app.

Realistically 90% of data requests will be adding a measurement or accessing records of the last month / 30 days. Viewing / Exporting them all is needed rarely.
This could be used to avoid reading data that is not accessed, by splitting measurements across different files. 2 different implementations come to mind:
- Splitting measurements year/month-wise and just loading the most recent file. This has the disadvantage that requesting read permissions for a file on Android takes long (compared to reading a big file) so transition periods between 2 intervals might take longer.
- Having one large file with all measurements and a cache file might solve this problem This is not ideal for adding new measurements, which would need to be added to 2 files (a potential solution could be a format that allows appending, but this still depends on whether the actual OS / Dart implementation reads the file before). Another issue is that there needs to be a last accessed date which will be complicated to store and update.

=> Splitting might not be needed at all, depending on the performance of reading large uncompressed files.

Both approaches have the problem that the file integrity is not checked and once corrupted measurements can be hard to recover. Text entered in notes can mess with separation-characters and parsing (like during export!).

#### Notes

- Taking notes is not very common and will be viewed even less they could be turned into optionally saved fields.
- In practice performance isn't an issue with using an SQL database, it might be fine to still use sql, but through other structures in making expanding easier. Or libraries: [psqlite](https://pub.dev/packages/psqlite)","['dev', 'code structure']",data storage

https://github.com/deadlyjack/Acode/issues/874,Acode loses connection and doesn't notify,"A few times a day (for the past couple of weeks), and today several times in an hour, Acode appeared to lose its connection to my server and did not attempt to reconnect, nor did it produce any error when the file saves were unsuccessful. 

If the file browser is open, the directory name sometimes flashes but not always. (BTW: Even if that indicator consistently worked, I normally hide the tree while editing.)  Perhaps it doesn't always flash because the disconnect is not disconnected, or perhaps the connection is fine and the saving function is unresponsive for some reason. Either way, the yellow ""unsaved"" dot is removed, so there's no visual indication of the problem. I only know after trying to test my code for ten minutes and start wondering why my changes aren't appearing.

The only resolution is to restart and lose my changes. Or if I am certain the code is working, I need to copy the content of the files and paste them back to the files when a new connection is established.

Now delete everything with :%d

Vim will crash. I assume it runs out of memory. Does not work on small files with a few lines. But does work consistently with a big file like my vimrc.

This also crashes Vim Touch if you kill everything in visual mode (e.g. ggvGx). For some reason doing :g/.*/d will not cause a crash the way normal mode commands seem to.

https://github.com/ValleZ/Paper-Wallet/issues/41,Misuse of AsyncTask,"According to our research, there are misuses about the following servral AsyncTask classes:
( in ru.valle.btc. MainActivity.java)
```
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, KeyPair> addressGenerateTask;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, GenerateTransactionResult> generateTransactionTask;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, KeyPair> switchingCompressionTypeTask;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, KeyPair> switchingSegwitTask;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, KeyPair> decodePrivateKeyTask;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, Object> bip38Task;
    @Nullable
    private AsyncTask<Void, Void, ArrayList<UnspentOutputInfo>> decodeUnspentOutputsInfoTask;
```

The problems are:
1. They are anonymous inner classes. They hold strong reference to the GUI element of Activity( MainActivity ), which can lead to memory leak when the Activity is destroyed and the AsyncTask did not finish
2. Their instances are cancelled before the Activity is destroyed. But in the doInBackground method there are for or while loop without the call of isCancelled() . These loops may not be able to terminate when the task is cancelled. This will cause waste of resources or even flashback

I think we can make following changes to fix the misuse problems:
1. I think the GUI-related fields should be wrapped into WeakReference. Take 
`private final MainActivity _context` as example, it can be changed to `private final WeakReference<MainActivity> _context`.
2. Every loop should check the status of AsyncTask to break the loop.
```
while(condition1){
     if(isCancelled()){
          break;
     }
     //blablabla…
     while(condition2){
         if(isCancelled()){
              break;
         }

https://github.com/vauvenal5/yaga/issues/158,feature request: store thumbnails locally,"hi.

i looked didn't see anyone asking for this. i'd like better offline usability in the yaga app.

is it possible to have downloaded image thumbnails stored locally on the device, so that one could browse a photo library while offline. i'd also like to see full size images cached locally when viewed, but to have that cache size-limited and those cached images cleaned out based on last access date.

basically, i'd like to have yaga operate like ios photos app. this keeps the memory used on the device to a minimum, while allowing limited offline usability in the form of cached thumbnails and recent images.

https://github.com/vauvenal5/yaga/issues/80,Pagination,"Currently the app always loads all files form the specified folder(s). In cases where this results in a lot of files (~10k) this process requires a feelable amount of time. Another issue with this approach is, although yet not reported by anybody, the memory consumption of the app. Going form a few files to ~10k loaded files results in almost doubling our memory footprint. In numbers from around 150M to 300M. So a good guess would be that with around 30k files we would run dangerously close to Android killing the app for overusing the memory.

A solution for this is to introduce pagination instead of loading all files at once. This, however, comes with a lot of open issues. We have to touch almost every part of the app for this to work. Any kind of filtering and searching has now to be done by the Nextcloud server to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

This issue will be used to collect all the relevant issues and general ideas for solving this long term.

The following things will have to be done:
- Read up on WebDav and Nextcloud support for paging.
- Validate/Contribute paging support to Nextcloud Dart lib.
- Delete Syncs have to be solved based on the Activity log instead of file deltas. #77 
- Quality checks have to be improved before starting this #9/#8 
- Search has to request results from server instead of performing local filtering.
- Offline mode will still load everything? What is the fallback strategy? How does search behave in offline mode?","['enhancement', 'post-v1.0.0', 'blocked']",memory consumption

Unfortunately, OBS itself doesn't offset it's monitor audio, so I have a system out of earshot watching the resulting stream. I'd like to use some websocket control software to update that audio Sync Offset remotely while watching the monitor so I can get frame perfect sync, and OBS Blade looks like a great base but doesn't expose this setting. Luckily the websocket API does provide this control.",[],latency

I believe that the latency would not be good in the case of using a VNC web server like AWS, but a localhost could have a much lower latency.

But basically two finger tapping doesn't seem to work reliably, at least i haven't figured out a way to do it reliably. I have it bound to bring up my keyboard, but I've tried it with other things like right click as well with the same effect. It'd be wonderful if you could look into this. 

Thanks ! :)

I tried setup it,  choosing WiFi and hostname as `archie` which is the output of my `/etc/hostname`

By any chance, can I make it to work? Is there cli client for android, so I could run it by adb

I tried KDE Connect, notification working with it. That's a good project, but I only need notification, so I find KDE Connect bloat.

Thanks very much :)

https://github.com/jimmod/ShareToComputer/issues/12,Addition of Categories and share history features to share to computer,"
# Introduction

Share to Computer is an Android application that makes sharing files from mobile phones to computer easier. You just need to select the files you want to send and share to computer. This will generate a link to be inputted on the computer browser where you can download the file shared.

# Components

My Suggestion is on the 
* Landing page

# Proposal

> ShareToComputer is a decent application that reduces the stress most users go through just to send a piece of file to their computer. I believe the application can still be improved.

* **Categories-** Trying to send files on ShareToComputer is kind of stressful if the files are not recent or together. That is why I propose that the files should be categorized. The categories will include **Music**, **Videos**, **Photo Gallery**, **Files**. Each of these categories will contain similar files. For example, the music category will include all music files. This is the same with the Video and photo gallery. The **Files** category will include files that can not be categorized.

* **Share History-** Users can only send files but can’t see what they have sent in the future. I propose the addition of a **Share history** feature that will display all sent files and the date sent.

# Mockups/Examples

The above is how I want the **categories** feature to be enhanced. You can see that the music button has only music files in there. That will be the same for other categories.

![Comb19062019133747.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmQTL3iFTM2Q7R1SEFV6hbBhxmeX4kPAabEWnYjRtnLeCw/Comb19062019133747.jpg)

This image is how I want the **Share history** to be implemented. You can see that the files sent can be seen and the date sent plus the device sent to.
# Benefits

**Categories-** This is an important feature that will reduce the time spent in finding the file to send. Imagine someone that want to send multiple video files in different locations, with the current mode of the application that is impossible. The user have to be selecting the video in each of the categories and sent. With the categories feature, the user can see all the videos on the device and choose anyone to send. It saves time and stress used to search and share videos one after the other.

**Share History-** This is another important feature that will let users see their past files sent. It helps to avoid situation of double sending. I often like transferring some of my pictures to my computer to increase available storage space. The presence of a history feature will make me avoid situations where I send a file twice. I can easily check the history and see the files I have sent. You can also see the device name you sent the files to.

# Conclusion

The application is one useful one because it cuts out the use of external devices such as cables, flash drives to send things between your phone and computer. Implementing my suggestions will make it more desirable for the general public. It will reduce the time and also cut out stress associated with finding the files to send.

ich öffne mal diese Issue für die Kompatibilität mit der Karte der TU Dortmund. Momentan kann die App noch gar nicht mit der Karte kommunizieren - ""Communicating with Card failed"".

Unfortunately the recent OTA update for the OnePlus 5 has a significant battery drain issue when this app is installed.

Model: ONEPLUS A5000
OxygenOS: v5.0.1
Android: v8.0.0
App: v2.2.4 (from [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.uhasselt.privacypolice&hl=en))

The screenshot below covers an 8-hour period where I installed and removed the app every so often.
As you can see the ""Awake"" bar is solid when the app is installed, and significantly more empty when the app is not installed, additionally the battery discharge curve is significantly steeper with the app installed... which is what drew my attention to the problem in the first place (significantly shorter battery life).

I would be happy to collect more data if you like, though I'm afraid I'll need guiding.

https://github.com/retrowars/retrowars/issues/82,Allow for sliding finger movement between directional controls,"**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**

When playing Asteroids etc,on a phone, the need to lift a digit from one rotation ""button"" before placing on the other can be awkward during heated game play.

**Describe the solution you'd like**

It would be nice if it were possilble to simply swipe back and forth between the two controls.

**Describe alternatives you've considered**

I don't know much about implementing touchscreen controls, but maybe an area that simply senses a direction of finger movement would be an alternative, although it might require a user-adjustable ""dead zone"" to get the best latency without accidental direction changes.

**Additional context**

Having the corners of the game screen obscured by fingers can sometimes be a problem in and of itself. I personally might prefer a 4:3 aspect game screen with controls outside of this (the wide aspect ratio feels a little weird for retro games anyway, to be honest). That aside, this project is an interesting concept, thanks for working on it!",[],latency
https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-android/issues/1276,[Issue]: Fire Stick 4K Max (2023) high latency,"### Describe the bug

The Fire Stick 4K Max (2023) has higher than expected latency given the hardware specs compared to the last generation (2021).

I observed the following benchmarks:
- 4K60 50Mbps HEVC: 18ms average (similar H.264)
- 1080p60 50Mbps HEVC: 15ms average (similar H.264)

Enabling Game Mode on the Fire Stick did not make any difference. For comparison, the previous generation Fire Stick 4K Max (2021) achieves 4K60 80Mbps HEVC at 4ms average.

Setup:
- 5900X / 3080Ti / 2.5GbE Ethernet
- Sunshine: NVENC preset P1 (lowest latency)
- ASUS AXE6600 (ET8) (Wifi 6E)

One additional thing I noticed is that it seems to receive network bottlenecking after 50Mbps where my network latency jumps from 2-3ms to 8-12ms. This is tested using Wifi 6E on AXE6600 router (no other clients have network issues running 4K120 150Mbps). Using the built in Fire Stick internet speed test, I am seeing a max download speed of 419Mbps. This network issue may be hardware related but was not observed on the previous generation.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Download Moonlight on Fire Stick 4K Max (2023)
2. Connect to a PC
3. Enable Moonlight statistic
4. Start any game

### Affected games

Tested using Desktop and opened Minecraft, Heaven Benchmark, and Timespy.

### Other Moonlight clients

### Moonlight adjusted settings

Yes

### Moonlight adjusted settings (please complete the following information)

I have tested using H.265 and H.264. Adjusted bitrate from 20-80Mbps (observed the bottlenecking past 50Mbps).

Note that the icons representing each game, as seen on the chooser, are generated from screenshots (in a similar way to upstream) so cannot benefit from this. The screenshots are of course generated by running the game with [these save files](https://github.com/chrisboyle/sgtpuzzles/tree/main/app/src/main/jni/icons) and I could imagine generating SVGs instead, but the missing piece of that is an SVG-writing implementation of the Puzzles drawing API, and I'm not convinced it's worth creating one.","['feature', 'controls']",app size

( in com.tananaev.logcat. MainActivity)
```
private ReaderTask readerTask;
//……
private class ReaderTask extends AsyncTask<Void, StatusUpdate, Void> 
```
The problems is:
1. It is inner class. It holds strong reference to the GUI element of Activity( MainActivity ), which can lead to memory leak when the Activity is destroyed and the AsyncTask did not finish.

I think we can make following changes to fix the misuse problems:
1. I think the GUI-related fields should be wrapped into WeakReference. Take 
`private final MainActivity _context` as example, it can be changed to `private final WeakReference<MainActivity> _context`.",[],memory leak

### Why do you want this feature?

The main purpose of the widget should be to inform the user how much data volume is currently available.
In the current widget, however, this information is subordinate. In contrast, the information placed on the top level about the volume used is actually only secondary information.

### Describe the Feature you'd like

Have an option to automatically hide the data consumption notification when mobile data is not activated.

### Why do you want this feature?

I spend a good bunch of time using my phone with mobile data disactivated, but DataMonitor's notihication stays there.
Modern smartphones love to have hundreds of little icons at the top of their screen, if DataMonitor did its part and hid itself when it is not relevant to see its informations, that would help a lot.

### Describe the Feature you'd like

Currently, the usage bar for each app uses the same blue color gradient to represent the total usage.

Make the bar use 2 different color gradients to represent sent/received data (eg. green/blue)

### Why do you want this feature?

Be able at a glance get the sent/received data usage ratio for the apps without having to open the details page.

### Describe the Feature you'd like

Add new app usage filter type to display combined mobile and Wi-Fi data for eg. called `All` or `Mobile and Wifi`.

On the selected app page, beside the `Total data usage` there can be 2 new data usage fields:

- `Mobile` - usage out of total
- `Wifi` - usage out of total

Probably most of the field names can be replaced with icons to take less space and make it look better. Example, for inspiration, what the app usage page in GlassWire looks like:

### Describe the Feature you'd like

A line diagram widget would be very informative.

- This line diagram shows cumulative used data from a given time period.
- Abscissa can be set to various times: from \<date\> to \<date\>; period of current data plan; this day; this week; this month; this quarter; this year.
- Ordinate to show the cumulative data amount.
- If a data plan with data limit is active, a horizontal line to indicate its total. This will allow the user to estimate whether (and when) a given plan will be exhausted. Alternatively, let the user manually set the data amount to be indicated by this line.
- Different cumulative lines and limit lines with different color schemes for different data plans; at the minimum separate for Mobile and Wifi.
- The widget should come in different sizes from  1x1 thru 1x5, 2x1..2x5, 3x1..3x5, etc., so the user can chose what is legible for them and adapt to various time scales and resolutions of data usage.



### Why do you want this feature?

To have an information at a glance what the data use and its relation to data plans is. Line Diagram is much easier to grasp than written figures.

- [X] This issue contains only one feature request.

### Describe the Feature you'd like

The diagram in This Week's Overview needs several improvements:

- Do not use a color gradient for two distinct sets of data (where is the border between Mobile and Wifi?). Instead, use contrasting solid colors or patterns. Or at the very least a horizontal line as border. 

- Do not stack distinct sets of data, that makes it difficult to estimate the amount in the top-stacked set. Better use separate columns for Mobile and Wifi data. People are more interested in data usage for each individually (esp. mobile) than for the sum of them. 

- The figures on the data columns are in a too small font, not legible on higher resolution devices.

- Make the abscissa a sliding 7-day window. That is much more useful than a fixed Monday-Sunday week (what use is a ""Week's"" overview on a Monday when there is only data of one day?).




### Why do you want this feature?

To make the diagram more useful.

In version 3.8.5 (9a11e3e4bf800abf925130f6aec9a3e939e71254), the SSH/SFTP connection to my Alibaba Cloud SFTP Server showed ""No file"" instead of displaying right files. 
While in version 3.8.4 (0185003458dedbeddf7cf4a3c8a2d9c1dbaccda7), I repeated the same procedure, and got the right result.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Create Cloud Connection
2. Choose SCP/SFTP Connection
3. Choose SSH/SFTP Protocol
4. Input the IP Address, Username, and Password
5. Click CREATE
6. It Showed a popup-window ""Login Failure: wrong username or password.""
7. It Jumped to the ""SCP/SFTP connection"" Page but Displayed ""No file"", and Showed the popup-window in Procedure 6 Again. 

**Expected behavior**
Get files on SFTP Server displayed.

Sometimes when I would click a script widget I noticed ~~the script would run a second time~~ there would be a 1-3 second startup delay. Then experimented and narrowed it down to a specific situation.

**Steps to reproduce**
 - Use Oneplus Launcher
 - Close a recent app other than Termux
 - Immediately launch a Termux widget icon

**Expected behavior**
Script runs immediately.

**Actual behavior**
Delay of 1-5 seconds before launch.

#### What problem are you trying to solve?

Good, I would like to mount with the app my ""uptobox"" unit, not being able to create it directly from the application, I put the external rclone.conf created by me on pc, and it gives me error in the app apparently for not being supported. However, on pc, with rclone I can see and use perfectly my remote through commands or even with rclonebrowser.

#### What should RCX be able to do differently to help with this problem?
<!-- describe your ideas: how would you solve this problem?  -->

Note that their recording services are started at app launch time, and are not running before; I did ""Force stop"" in the Android settings, to be sure.

My use case is that I am not an Android dev and my stack traces are from new features of F-droid apps. I open the log after the crash (happens circa once a month) and copy-paste straight into GH. I do not take the time to find minimal reproducer steps anyway, as the stack trace is usually clear enough. So if I switched to MatLog, I would open the log *after* the crash.

Next I have a question about your opinion on including a status overview.
It is great to see the overview of past CPU states, but what I also would like to see is the current CPU usage, maybe RAM etc.
The request comes from my past using of AeroControl, but I don't have a rooted phone anymore.

Here is a reference to show what I mean:

https://github.com/SpazeDog/mounts2sd/issues/24,ROM very slow after installing mounts2SD,"Hei,

thanks for the nice program. After I instaleld and set it up my ROM is very slow reacting. Sure, the phone is old and not the fastes, but without the app it was running smooth enough. Here my specs:

ZTE Blade (gen. 2)
CM 10.2 (Android 4.3.1) from KonstaT with gapps
ClockWorkMod Version 6.0.1.4.
Information from the App ""Blade Checker"":
European Blade (512MB RAM) detected
TPT Upgrade Gen 2 Phone detected
Use Gen 1 style TPTs
Current partition sizes:
System: 215MB
Data: 203MB
Cache: 37MB

Coz, I couldn´t install WhatsApp (too less storage space) I tried your app. It looks like the access to the SD card is very slow (maybe?). It is an 8GB card set up like this:

first partition: 5GB (primary, FAT32)
2nd partition: 2,6GB (primary, ext3)

Thanks for your help,

as the title says, my seadroid mobile App on Android seems not to automatically upload images when not being in Wifi, but mobile data is allowed to be used for uploading. My phonet setup is:
* Sim 1: a cheap 10 € card to have a phone numer - mobile data usage disallowed
* Sim 2: my regular phone contract with mobile data flat, and with allowed mobile data to be used by apps

Might it be the case that the Android app is used to check Sim 1 only? When i change the order of sim cards physically, it works properly. So it seems to be a bug

https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/1158,PulseAudio doesn't create /tmp/snapfifo pipe,"**Describe the bug**
I'm trying to run Snapcast on Raspberry Pi that acts as a Bluetooth receiver. I want to pair my phone with the Pi, stream music via Bluetooth and redirect the stream to Snapcast's `/tmp/snapfifo` pipe. The problem is that after following the [steps for PulseAudio](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/develop/doc/player_setup.md#pulseaudio) the stream is never redirected to Snapcast, because PulseAudio doesn't even create the named pipe.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. First I verified that BT streaming works without Snapcast. I'm using https://github.com/nicokaiser/rpi-audio-receiver to convert RPi to a Bluetooth receiver and it works without any issues when streaming music to the built-in audio card.
2. I added the lines from [the guideline](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/develop/doc/player_setup.md#pulseaudio) to my `/etc/pulse/system.pa`
```
...
load-module module-pipe-sink file=/tmp/snapfifo sink_name=Snapcast format=s16le rate=48000
update-sink-proplist Snapcast device.description=Snapcast
```
3. I restarted the pulseaudio systemd service. I also tried rebooting.
4. I confirmed with `pactl list sinks` that the PulseAudio sink is created and is set to RUNNING when I start streaming music.
```
Sink #1
	State: RUNNING

	Driver: module-pipe-sink.c
	Sample Specification: s16le 2ch 48000Hz

	Owner Module: 15
	Mute: no
	Volume: front-left: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB,   front-right: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB
	       balance 0.00
	Base Volume: 65536 / 100% / 0.00 dB
	Monitor Source: Snapcast.monitor
	Latency: 226208 usec, configured 21333 usec
	Flags: DECIBEL_VOLUME LATENCY 
	Properties:
		device.string = ""/tmp/snapfifo""
		device.description = ""Snapcast""
		device.icon_name = ""audio-card""
	Formats:
		pcm
```
5. I checked if snapcast received the stream to the pipe, but there's nothing. The pipe isn't even created, or if I create it manually it's not being written to by PulseAudio.

Are the guidelines outdated? Or is my PulseAudio setup still somewhat misconfigured?

https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/1157,Defunct child processes created when using script mixer in snapclient,"**Describe the bug**
Running snapclient in script mixer mode creates a defunct process for each invocation of the mixer script upon adjusting the snapclient volume via a command from the snapserver.

This appears to be caused by the snapclient immediately [detaching](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/blob/develop/client/player/player.cpp#L251) from the child process and never waiting for it to complete.  My understanding is that until the child is collected it will remain in the process table.  In this case, the detached child processes are only removed from the process table when the parent process exits.

Forking the process twice appears to be a common way to solve this on UNIX systems.  The main process forks a child process and waits for it.  The child process forks and execs the script,  immediately detaches from the grandchild process that is running the script and exits.  This keeps the wait in the main process short and allows the detached grandchild process to be collected by the system because its parent process has completed.

From what I can tell, the Boost process library does not support this kind of process management due to its lack of portability between systems.  Any way to make snapclient wait on the volume script process?

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Install snapclient from package: `sudo apt install snapclient`
2. Configure snapclient to run a script to set volume: Set SNAPCLIENT_OPTS=""--mixer script:/home/pi/bin/snapclient-volume.sh"" in `/etc/default/snapclient` and restart the snapclient `sudo service restart snapclient`
3. Adjust the volume for the client on the snapserver
4. Observe a defunct process for each time the volume was adjusted

- OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
- Snapcast version: snapclient v0.23.0
- Installed from: apt install snapclient

https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/1154,ALSA playback fails when outputting to dshares since v0.23.0,"**Describe the bug**
Snapclient cannot playback via ALSA PCM when the output device (-s) is a dshare. Snapclient will report repeated messages suggesting the PCM device is in an invalid state. Bug can be traced to the change to alsa_player.cpp at commit 273ad9622847ee8fa73d5de9de6bea99b34d352f. Bug persists through the current commit. Commenting out the offending code block from the current commit restores playback functionality. 

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Set up a dshare in /etc/asound.conf to split a USB sound card into multiple outputs
2. Run snapclient and target a dshare output device.
3. Observe no playback and error messages in the logfile.

**Environment details**
- OS: Raspbian Bullseye on Pi3B+ with external USB 7.1 sound card
- Snapcast version 0.23.0 and up since 273ad9622847ee8fa73d5de9de6bea99b34d352f.
- Installed from a package, self compiled, ... - Either.

Issue does not occur when using non-dshare outputs such as the native headphone output from the Pi.
Perhaps it's an issue with how I've set up the dshare. I've yet to digest how those few lines of code in alsa_player are breaking the PCM output.
I did instrument one build to monitor the state, and snapclient reported it to be PREPARED the whole time it was choking on chunks.
Again, deleting lines 448-452 from the v0.27.0 release of alsa_player.cpp gives me a working build at the latest rev.",[],latency
https://github.com/badaix/snapcast/issues/1126,Clients go out of sync after silence in source material,"**Describe the bug**
I have 3 clients. All Raspberry Pis. One is also running the snapserver and Mopidy.
My snapserver is fed from Mopidy via an ALSA loopback device. I'm encountering issues when playing certain sources that the 3 clients go out of sync briefly, but only after a short period of silence in the source material.

When this happens I see errors on all 3 clients *simultaneously*, for example after a short silence (< 1s)
`pMiniBuffer->full() && (abs(pMiniBuffer->mean()) > 50)`
and after a slightly longer silence
```
Exception: Not enough frames available, requested frames: 3899, available: 882
Failed to get chunk
XRUN while waiting for PCM: Broken pipe
```
When the silence ends all 3 clients are out of sync for a moment before they come back into sync again. I've read all the other reports about handling those kinds of errors but no matter what I change it makes no difference - it's is definitely related to the sliences in the source material.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Play a file which has a section of complete silence of around 1s. I've used Mopidy and FFMpeg to play such a file into the ALSA loopback device.

https://github.com/cotechde/termbot/issues/12,Scrollback problems,"## Bug description
With a scrollback set to `999999999999` I only get 120 lines of scrollback max.

## Steps to reproduce
1. Go to settings and set scrollback to `999999999999`
2. Open a session and  run a command producing lots of output. My suggestion: `i=9999; while [ $i -gt 0 ]; do echo $i; let i--;done`.
3. Scroll back to the top and check how far you got (in my case usually 116, 117)

## Expected behavior
Scrollback extends further

## Android device

 - Device: Nokia 9
 - OS: Android 9
 - TermBot Version: 1.9.5-77

## Additional context
when I set the scrollback to `999999999` scrolling back works exactly once, but further scrolling is broken (can't scroll neither up or down).

I would actually wish for an infinite scrollback, that doesn't require any configuration. Sessions on a mobile device aren't that long lived anyways (in my experience), but when I try to debug something on the road having to explicitly use pagers gets problematic, as the network latency becomes a factor.

Also I would conclude that there is a limit on the configuration item for scrollback, that only gets validated once a session is started, not when the user configures scrollback.

There's a Steam transport running at `steam.my.server` which I have made myself (using SleekXMPP). Maybe it behaves somehow incorrect. However, I think it shouldn't cause such problems for Xabber – it it doesn't understand something, it should ignore it.

Can you imagine where the problem comes from and what I can do about it? Can I somehow assist in fixing that? Meanwhile, I will investigate on the transport/server side, but I think the client should ignore the problem, too (if there even is one).",['bug'],"unresponsive

Thus, I’d like to propose a data-saver mode. Ideas on how that might be established include:

- Use only cached images, don’t download new ones—unless user tapped on image if they absolutely want to download the image
- Reduce request data
   - Even higher zoom level necessary to have the app download hosts

https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/issues/218,NetworkOnMainThread exception when attempting to send rawlines while connected to a IRC bouncer,"I'm connecting to a [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) bouncer running on a server somewhere to access some irc networks. 

When I try to do anything that ultimately hits [this method](https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/blob/master/pircbot/src/main/java/org/yaaic/protocol/OutputThread.java#L59) (for example, `/nick` or `/join`) nothing happens. 

Debugging a little, an exception is being thrown [here](https://github.com/pocmo/Yaaic/blob/master/pircbot/src/main/java/org/yaaic/protocol/OutputThread.java#L66). The exception stacktrace thrown is included at the bottom. TL;DR it's a NetworkOnMainThreadException.

When I connect to an irc network directly I do not see that exception and can change nick, join channels etc as you'd normally expect. 

What's the difference between connecting to my bouncer and connecting to an IRC network directly? No clue. It might be latency and that going direct is fast enough that it doesn't trigger the exception (though I kinda doubt this as you'd still expect slower connections to see this issue then). From the debugging information I can see that I am on the main thread in both cases when attempting to write to the buffer.

Whatever the reason networking on the main thread is bad. When I wrap that buffer write in something like this everything works as expected when connecting to the bouncer:

```
    Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(new Runnable() {
        @Override public void run() {
            bwriter.write(line + ""\r\n"");
            bwriter.flush();   
        }
    });
```

I can submit a fix for this easily enough but I don't want to be naively spinning up threads here there and everywhere. I suspect everything could be put on a background thread a long ways up the line instead of just before writing to the buffer but don't have enough context right now to see where the best place might be. If you have a suggestion I can go about fixing it :) (I will submit a PR soon either way, this bug is really annoying me)

This is also an issue in the version of Yaaic published on the play store.

https://github.com/mathisdt/trackworktime/issues/144,Synchronisation with calendar,"Because I use de-googlified phone I cannot use google backup.

I like to propose a way how to:
1. Backup data
2. Synchronise data
3. Visualise data

By adding option to using a calendar as ""data storage"". It should be possible to select specific calendar.

With this feature, user can not only backup/synchronise data with any calendar service (like https://www.etesync.com), but also visualise records in any calendar app.

https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/issues/1133,Notification not updated on last build - Potentially FOUND A FIX,"Hello, Persian Calendar community!

I was working on a custom calendar with the same code base when I noticed that there is an issue with updating notifications.

I found a fix for that and hope for community help to refactor my code and well-design it. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to test  with other apps' functions for the lack of a good laptop running an Android 11+ emulator.  Bad for me :)

The method : 

First of all, I removed a weak reference from the application service class to a normal instance (I actually know this may cause a memory leak  but just for a dirty test).


![application-service-removed-weak-reference](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/550742f6-3122-4918-9253-d363a9e4d936)



Then, in the Application Service class, move important notifications and the **update()** method to Oncreate() and set the instance to this:


![Application-service-set-instance-this](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/1e46de45-c85a-4720-8f1d-627a1dd9539f)



In the Update function, I noticed that you used the same channel ID and notification to create notification. I made them different. Below, you can observe the areas where they should differ...


I changed PRIORITY from **LOW  to  NotificationCompat.PRIORITY_DEFAULT** in **Update()** method too.


![same-notification-id-and-channel-id](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/154d6267-fa27-4c0f-9315-fa1d17b181a3)

![use_channel_id_correctly](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/d5cf41e5-0dc2-463d-9871-8348039aa5be)

Finally, in Main Activity where you call Function,
startEitherServiceOrWorker() uses the **application context** instead of **this**.

Call **startEitherServiceOrWorker(applicationContext)**.

![MainActivity-set-application-context-instead-of-this](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/75fe924f-0146-4d39-a5c9-7e0d73226597)





note that on android 8+ foreground service should be started like this :

  if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
                    ContextCompat.startForegroundService(
                        context,
                        Intent(context, ApplicationService::class.java)
                    )else{
                    context.startService(Intent(context, ApplicationService::class.java))
                    }

![Screenshot_2023-07-31_01-44-31](https://github.com/persian-calendar/persian-calendar/assets/83671885/e57e30ee-84e2-4e88-af6c-9236aab4bd42)




Firstly, the problem is that after clearing the app from Recents the process will be executed again for some unknown reason and kill the service. But with the above instructions, you bind service to application, and other things like channel that I noticed may make a difference.

NOTE: Dear community, please confirm these results and check whether they are working or not.

 I noticed that this problem has existed for at least 2 years based on commits. I believe and hope my results will permanently fix this issue. Thanks to all Persian-Calendar community ansesters and contributors. It is my honor to be with you.

There are 2 Runnables in MainActivity and one in WeatherInfoActivity.

[They](https://github.com/Kestutis-Z/World-Weather/blob/master/WorldWeather/app/src/main/java/com/haringeymobile/ukweather/MainActivity.java#L128) will hold the Activity and prevent its timely release.
