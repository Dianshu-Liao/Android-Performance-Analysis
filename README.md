## Concluding Data in Our Paper

1. **`Literature_Review/data/Performance_Analysis_literature_review.xlsx`**: Contains detailed information on the 66 papers reviewed in our literature analysis, including Year, Cites, Pages, URL, Venue Type, Performance Issue, Factor, Approach Type, dataset link, and more.

2. **`Large_Scale_Exploration/Keywords.txt`**: A list of 87 keywords related to performance issues that we gathered from 100 websites and several foundation papers, supporting for our filtering step in the Large-Scale Exploration of Real-World Discussions on Android Performance Issues. 

3. **Real-World Data**:
   - **`Large_Scale_Exploration/Manually_Checked_Data/UserReviews_with_label.csv`**
   - **`Large_Scale_Exploration/Manually_Checked_Data/SO_data_with_label.csv`**
